# Assembler
I have written an assembler for the [HACK Architecture](https://github.com/saifulAbu/HACK-Architecture) from scratch following specification from the book [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686). Following project is [VM for HACK](https://github.com/saifulAbu/Virtual-Machine).

To understand and run the project, reader needs to read the book mentioned above.
